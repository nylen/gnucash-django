gnucash-django
==============

A mobile-friendly Web frontend for GnuCash, primarily written using Django.

Features
--------

 - View transactions in a GnuCash account, along with their "opposing
   account"

 - Filter by opposing account, transaction description, or transaction post
   date

 - Change the opposing account of any transaction and create rules for future
   transactions

 - Attach images to transactions

 - Add new transactions from the web interface

 - Import JSON files produced by my
   [`banker`](https://github.com/nylen/node-banker) transaction downloader and
   automatically categorize transactions according to the saved rules

 - Similarly, import QIF files and categorize transactions

Wishlist
--------

 - Budgeting, etc.

 - Better management of rules and categorization

Requirements
------------

 - A GnuCash file that uses a database backend (tested with MySQL; should work
   with Postgres or SQLite as well)

 - Pre-requisites (for Debian/Ubuntu):
   `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git python-dev libmysqlclient-dev`

 - `pip` and `virtualenv` installed (in Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python-pip`,
   then `sudo pip install virtualenv`)

 - _(Optional)_ Python GnuCash API installed (currently this is only used in the
   code that imports QIF files)

   After you've followed the installation steps below, something like this
   should work to make the GnuCash API visible to this application's virtual
   environment:

        ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnucash/ lib/python2.7/site-packages/

Installation
------------

 - Download the application code into a folder:

        git clone git://github.com/nylen/gnucash-django.git
        cd gnucash-django

 - Initialize `virtualenv` and install dependencies:

        virtualenv .
        . bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt

 - Copy `settings.example.py` to `settings.py` and fill in values for all
   places where the file contains three asterisks (`***`).  At this point
   you'll need to set up a MySQL database and username, if you haven't done so
   already.  Currently this must be done manually.

   You can use this command to generate a `SECRET_KEY` value:

        python -c 'import random; r=random.SystemRandom(); print "".join([r.choice("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)") for i in range(50)])'

 - Create the database structure: `python manage.py syncdb`

 - In the previous step, you should have been prompted to create a Django
   superuser.  If not, or you didn't create one, do that now by running
   `python manage.py createsuperuser`.  This will be your login to the site.

 - There are two options for starting the application:
   1. Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
   2. Configure Apache to host the application with mod\_wsgi.  Here is an
      example:

            WSGIDaemonProcess site.com processes=2 threads=15
            WSGIProcessGroup site.com

            WSGIScriptAlias /gnucash-django /path/to/gnucash-django/apache/money.wsgi
            <Location /gnucash-django>
              # This setup will allow everyone access to the application.
              # Even though visitors will have to log in, this is probably
              # still not a good idea and you should use Apache auth here.
              Order deny,allow
              Allow from all
            </Location>

      You may also want to set up a baseline environment for mod\_wsgi as
      described
      [here](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/VirtualEnvironments#Baseline_Environment).

      More information about configuring mod\_wsgi is on the
      [mod\_wsgi website](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/).

 - Browse to the site and log in as the superuser you created earlier.  Example
   URLs:
    - Django development server: `http://localhost:8000/`
    - Apache and mod\_wsgi: `http://localhost/gnucash-django/`

**NOTE**: Even though all views are set up to require authentication, this
application has **NOT** been written with security in mind.  Therefore, it is
advisable to secure it using HTTPS and Apache authentication, or to disallow
public access to the application.
